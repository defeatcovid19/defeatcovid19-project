# Onboarding Hospitals and Medical Clinics
Our effort to obtain as many datasets as possible is directed towards every hospital and medical clinic we can contact. 

A number of datasets are already available, but very few are related to COVID19. Moreover a lot of data is missing related to patients conditions and medical imaging. We aim to fill this gap and make dataset available to everyone.

### Onboarding status
Usually onboarding process follows these steps:

1. First contact
2. Brief introductory call about project objectives
3. Project description and data request sent
4. Ethical committee approval (if required)
5. Waiting for data
6. Data received
7. Dataset available

**Anyone that can push to speed up things or contact new hospitals, is heavily encouraged to do so and reach out directly to the [Support Team](support@defeatcovid19.org)**.

If a legal representative is required to sign request forms, we have a number of companies that are available to do this.

We used this [project brief and summary (at the moment in Italian-only)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6v2beQ4BTjvRMw0Lr2VQnJndkBGLhabcvrL8u97Ct0/edit#) to describe the project. You may find it useful as outline to contact your local hospitals.
